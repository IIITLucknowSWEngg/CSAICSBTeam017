## **1. Test Plan**  

### **1.1 Introduction**  
The purpose of this document is to outline the testing strategy, methodology, and test cases for the **Google Pay System**, ensuring robust quality standards. This document follows the IEEE-829-2008 standard and uses a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) approach.

---

### **1.2 Test Items**  
- User Management  
- Payment Transactions  
- Security and Fraud Prevention  
- Wallet and Bank Integration  

---

### **1.3 Features to be Tested**  
- **User Management System**: Registration, login, and profile features.  
- **Payment Transactions**: Peer-to-peer payments, bill payments, and refunds.  
- **Security**: OTP verification, encryption, and fraud detection.  
- **Integration**: Wallet management and bank linkage.  

---

### **1.4 Features Not to Be Tested**  
- NFC-based offline transactions.  
- Integration with cryptocurrency wallets (deferred to future phases).  

---

### **1.5 Testing Approach**  
The testing process includes:  
1. **Unit Testing**: Validating individual modules.  
2. **Integration Testing**: Ensuring proper interactions between components.  
3. **System Testing**: Testing the end-to-end functionality.  
4. **Acceptance Testing**: Validating against user requirements.  
5. **Performance Testing**: Ensuring scalability and responsiveness under load.  

**Testing Style**: Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) using **Cucumber** for Gherkin-style test scenarios and **Chai** for assertions.  

---

### **1.6 Pass/Fail Criteria**  
A test case is marked as **Pass** if actual outcomes match expected results. A test case is marked as **Fail** if there are deviations, performance issues, or errors.

---

### **1.7 Suspension and Resumption Criteria**  
- Testing will be **suspended** in the event of critical failures (e.g., server crashes, significant defects).  
- Testing will **resume** after defect resolution and retesting of the impacted areas. 

### **1.8 Test Environment**

| Component             | Details                              |  
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|  
| **Client Systems**    | Chrome (v114+), Firefox (v98+), Edge |  
| **Server Environment**| GCP (Compute Engine, BigQuery, Firebase) |  
| **Databases**         | MySQL (v8+)                         |  
| **Encryption**        | AES-256 for transaction encryption   |  
| **Testing Tools**     | Selenium, Postman, JMeter           |

## 3. Test Case Specification

### 3.1 User Registration
```gherkin
Feature: User Registration

  Scenario: Successful user registration
    Given a new user is on the registration page
    When the user enters valid registration details
    And the user submits the registration form
    Then the user account should be created
    And a verification email should be sent
```

```javascript
const chai = require('chai');
const expect = chai.expect;

describe('User Registration', () => {
  it('should create a user account and send a verification email', () => {
    const registrationDetails = {
      email: 'user@example.com',
      phone: '1234567890',
      password: 'SecurePass123!'
    };
    const result = registerUser(registrationDetails);
    expect(result).to.have.property('success', true);
    expect(result).to.have.property('verificationEmailSent', true);
  });
});
```

### 3.2 Peer-to-Peer Payment
```gherkin
Feature: Peer-to-Peer Payment

  Scenario: Successful peer-to-peer transaction
    Given a registered user has sufficient wallet balance
    When the user initiates a transaction to another user
    Then the transaction should be processed successfully
    And the recipient's wallet should be updated
```

```javascript
describe('Peer-to-Peer Payment', () => {
  it('should process the transaction and update wallets', () => {
    const transactionDetails = {
      senderId: 'user123',
      recipientId: 'user456',
      amount: 50
    };
    const result = processPeerPayment(transactionDetails);
    expect(result).to.have.property('processed', true);
    expect(result.senderBalance).to.be.a('number');
    expect(result.recipientBalance).to.be.a('number');
  });
});
```

### 3.3 Fraud Prevention
```gherkin
Feature: Fraud Prevention

  Scenario: Detect and block fraudulent transactions
    Given a user attempts a suspicious transaction
    When the system detects unusual patterns
    Then the transaction should be blocked
    And an alert should be raised
```

```javascript
describe('Fraud Prevention', () => {
  it('should block suspicious transactions and raise alerts', () => {
    const transactionDetails = {
      userId: 'user123',
      amount: 10000,
      location: 'Unknown'
    };
    const result = detectFraud(transactionDetails);
    expect(result).to.have.property('blocked', true);
    expect(result).to.have.property('alertRaised', true);
  });
});
```
